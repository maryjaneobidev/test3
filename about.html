                <h3>Developer / Designer</h3>
                <p>Hey there! I'm a sixth form student with a diverse set of interests. I'm aspiring to be a 'Software Developer', 'Fashion Designer', and perhaps 'Graphic Designer' — yes, quite the mix! 
                    I find joy in coding; it's like unlocking a world of endless possibilities. 
                    Problem-solving is like a special ability that I seem to have, and every coding challenge feels like solving a puzzle that I can't wait to crack. 
                    Beyond the tech industry, I'm also passionate about fashion and graphic design, where I can let my creativity run wild. Whether it's writing lines of code or sketching out a new design, 
                    the process of creation is what truly drives me. I'm on a journey of self-discovery, exploring the exciting intersection of technology and design.
                </p>
                <p> Crafting this game was an absolute thrill! I started from the ground up, using Unreal Engine and Unity to breathe life into my creative vision. The process involved countless hours of tweaking, testing, and refining to ensure a smooth and engaging experience. What makes this game special is its flexibility—players can plunge into the heart of the action through the intense first-person shooter mode or opt for a broader perspective in the third-person shooter mode.
            
                    Drawing inspiration from my extensive playtime in games like Call of Duty: Warzone, I set out to capture the essence of that adrenaline-pumping gameplay. The idea struck me to introduce a VR mode, enhancing the overall gaming adventure. Now, players can choose to immerse themselves in a virtual reality battlefield, feeling the intensity of every move. This addition provides a unique twist to the traditional gaming experience, offering a choice between classic and cutting-edge gameplay.
                    
                    The first-person shooter mode, tailored for VR enthusiasts, transports players into the midst of the action. It's an exhilarating experience where every decision matters, creating a sense of urgency and excitement. On the flip side, the third-person shooter mode offers a more strategic viewpoint. Players can carefully plan their moves and navigate the game with a wider scope. This flexibility ensures that the game caters to diverse playstyles, providing both intense close-quarters combat and a more tactical, calculated approach.
                    
                    Playable on various platforms like PC, console, and mobile devices, my game adapts to the preferences of a wide gaming audience. The seamless transition between VR and non-VR modes adds an extra layer of versatility, allowing players to enjoy the game in different ways. It's not just a game; it's a dynamic and inclusive gaming experience that I'm thrilled to share with fellow gaming enthusiasts.</p>
